I'm a PhD researcher in machine learning based in Edinburgh, UK. My work focuses on applying deep learning to real-world clinical problems using NHS imaging and patient data. I specialise in image analysis, multimodal learning, and low-data training strategies.

-  Currently: Final-year PhD candidate at Newcastle University
-  Focus: Deep learning under data constraints (OCT imaging, diabetic macular oedema)
-  Collaborations: NHS, Roche
-  Publications: MIDL, Remote Sensing, Journal of Ophthalmology, Informatics in Medicine Unlocked (see [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3PXeB9wAAAAJ&hl=en))

##  Featured Projects

Below are some selected works from my personal and academic research. My current focus is learning the full MLOps workflow and best practices.

- **[Multimodal Visual Acuity Prediction](https://github.com/muanderson/VA_MM_DL)**  
  Combines OCT retinal imaging and clinical data using a custom deep neural network to predict post-treatment visual acuity. Validated on real-world NHS datasets with strong clinical performance.  
  _Published at MIDL 2025_

- **[Incremental Self-labelling for 3D Medical Segmentation](https://github.com/muanderson/Incremental2D-SelfLabel3D)**  
  Self-supervised U-Net framework using just one annotated 2D slice to train 3D segmentation models. Demonstrated on diverse modalities (MRI, CT) with significant gains in label efficiency.  
  _Under review at BMC Medical Imaging_

- **[End-to-End Digit Recogniser](https://github.com/muanderson/Handwritten-digit-recogniser)**  
  End-to-End Digit Recognizer A complete MLOps pipeline for a handwritten digit recognizer, from initial training and fine-tuning to a live, deployed web application.
  _Implements experiment tracking with MLflow, containerisation with Docker, and deployment to Hugging Face Spaces_
  
- **[Shopee Product Matching (Kaggle)](https://github.com/muanderson/shopee-product-matching)**  
  End-to-end solution for large-scale duplicate product detection using image and text features. Combines CNN and transformer models with approximate nearest neighbour search for scalable inference.  
  _Explores multimodal embeddings, deep feature extraction, and similarity search at scale_
