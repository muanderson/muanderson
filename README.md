## 📌 Featured Projects

Here are some selected works from my academic research:

- **[Multimodal Visual Acuity Prediction](https://github.com/muanderson/VA_MM_DL)**  
  Combines OCT retinal imaging and clinical data using a custom deep neural network to predict post-treatment visual acuity. Validated on real-world NHS datasets with strong clinical performance.  
  _Published at MIDL 2025_

- **[Incremental Self-labelling for 3D Medical Segmentation](https://github.com/muanderson/Incremental2D-SelfLabel3D)**  
  Self-supervised U-Net framework using just one annotated 2D slice to train 3D segmentation models. Demonstrated on diverse modalities (MRI, CT) with significant gains in label efficiency.  
  _Under review at BMC Medical Imaging_

- **[Shopee Product Matching (Kaggle)](https://github.com/muanderson/shopee-product-matching)**  
  End-to-end solution for large-scale duplicate product detection using image and text features. Combines CNN and transformer models with approximate nearest neighbour search for scalable inference.  
  _Explores multimodal embeddings, deep feature extraction, and similarity search at scale_

- **SAR Target Recognition with GANs and CNNs**  
  Foliage-penetrating radar recognition using synthetic augmentation and ROC-thresholding.  
  _Published in Remote Sensing_
